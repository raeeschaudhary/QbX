info.faq.header=FAQ
info.faq.subHeader1.header1=What is QbCheck
info.faq.subHeader1.p1=QbCheck is an objective online tool that measures the level of ADHD symptoms and indicates whether a person should seek professional evaluation for the condition. The objective measurement of the three core symptoms of ADHD is compared to a group of person your age and gender but without ADHD to set the context for your result.
info.faq.subHeader1.header2=What does QbCheck measure?
info.faq.subHeader1.p2=QbCheck measures your movements and ability to pay attention and restrain impulsivity during a 15 or 20 minute test.
info.faq.subHeader1.header3=How long time does a test take?
info.faq.subHeader1.p3=The actual test is 15 minutes for children 6-11 years old and 20 minutes for persons aged 12-60. In addition to this you need to allow some time to watch or read instructions and prepare for the test.
info.faq.subHeader2=Preparing for a test
info.faq.subHeader2.header1=What is needed in order to perform a QbCheck?
info.faq.subHeader2.p1=You need a fairly new computer with a built-in camera or a separate web-camera and an internet connection. We will automatically check this when you start the test. The test cannot be performed on an iPad.
info.faq.subHeader2.p2=You need to use the Google Chrome or Firefox web browser for the test to work properly. If you try starting the test using another web browser you will get an error message.
info.faq.subHeader2.p3=We also recommend you to choose a quiet room and appropriate seating arrangement in order to receive as meaningful result as possible. For persons 6-11 years old a stool without armrests and backrest is recommended. For persons 12-60 you should choose a chair with backrest but no armrests.
info.faq.subHeader2.header2=Do I need to download anything to do the test?
info.faq.subHeader2.p4=No, you don’t have to download a specific QbCheck program, everything is managed online on our website. However, you need to use the Google Chrome or Firefox web browser for the test to work properly.
info.faq.subHeader2.header3=Can I perform the test on an iPad?
info.faq.subHeader2.p5=No, you need to use a laptop or a regular desk top computer placed on a steady table. This is important in order to get a correct result since the activity measurements are sensitive.
info.faq.subHeader2.header4=Will I be filmed during the test?
info.faq.subHeader2.p6=No, you will not be filmed during the test. The camera only measures how much you move through a tracking algorithm. This means that no actual filming is made and no data will be stored that can link your test back to you.
info.faq.subHeader2.header5=Do I need my parent’s consent to take the test?
info.faq.subHeader2.p7=Yes, if you are under the age of 18 you will need your parents’ consent to take a QbCheck. You will need to confirm this in the test to get started.
info.faq.subHeader2.header6=Is parental supervision needed during the test?
info.faq.subHeader2.p8=We recommend parents to supervise children/adolescent up to the age of 16.
info.faq.subHeader2.header7=Which factors can affect my result?
info.faq.subHeader2.p9=Alcohol and medications that might affect your ability to pay attention can affect your result on the test and should therefore not be used.
info.faq.subHeader3=Technical Questions
info.faq.subHeader3.header1=Why is it important to be seated 60 cm/24 inches from the camera?
info.faq.subHeader3.p1=This is important in order to get as accurate measurements and results as possible.
info.faq.subHeader3.header2=What does “Detecting Face” during the camera check mean?
info.faq.subHeader3.p2=The “Detecting face” feature is a way for us to assure that your camera has the capability to detect and track your face during the test.
info.faq.subHeader3.header3=What does “Checking the Computer Performance” during the camera check mean?
info.faq.subHeader3.p3=The “Checking the Computer Performance” feature is a way for us to assure that your computer is fast enough to perform a QbCheck.
info.faq.subHeader3.header4=During the test
info.faq.subHeader3.header4.h1=How long time does a test take?
info.faq.subHeader3.p4=The actual test is 15 minutes for children 6-11 years old and 20 minutes for persons aged 12-60.
info.faq.subHeader3.header5=What happens with the result if I quit an ongoing test?
info.faq.subHeader3.p5=A result will not be made available if you quit the test before it is finished. A completed test is needed to get accurate comparisons to your norm group. Of course you will not be charged for a test that is not completed.
info.faq.subHeader3.header6=What happens if I don’t manage to get the practice test right?
info.faq.subHeader3.p6=You will be directed back to the instructions and can then try the practice test again. You need to complete the practice test successfully before going to the real test. This is important in order to ensure that there are no misunderstandings and that you will get a meaningful result.
info.faq.subHeader4=Report Questions
info.faq.subHeader4.header1=How do I get access to my report?
info.faq.subHeader4.p1=During the clinical test you will not be able to see your result report. Please talk to your study doctor regarding any questions about this.
